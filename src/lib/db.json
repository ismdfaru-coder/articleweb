      "excerpt": "Exploring how artificial intelligence is reshaping the landscape of coding, testing, and deployment.",
      "content": "\n      <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept but a present-day reality transforming industries, and software development is no exception. From automated code generation to intelligent testing and deployment pipelines, AI is poised to revolutionize how we build software.</p>\n      <h2 class=\"font-headline text-2xl font-bold my-4\">AI-Powered Coding Assistants</h2>\n      <p>Tools like GitHub Copilot are already augmenting developers' capabilities, suggesting entire functions and code blocks in real-time. This not only speeds up development but also helps developers learn new patterns and APIs. As these tools become more sophisticated, they could handle more complex logic, freeing up developers to focus on architecture and problem-solving.</p>\n      <h2 class=\"font-headline text-2xl font-bold my-4\">Intelligent Testing and Debugging</h2>\n      <p>AI algorithms can analyze codebases to predict where bugs are most likely to occur. They can generate intelligent test cases that cover edge cases humans might miss. When bugs do appear, AI can analyze stack traces and suggest potential fixes, drastically reducing debugging time.</p>\n      <blockquote class=\"border-l-4 border-primary pl-4 italic my-4\">\"The goal is not to replace developers, but to empower them with tools that handle the repetitive and predictable, so they can focus on the creative and innovative.\"</blockquote>\n      <p>The integration of AI into the software development lifecycle is not just an efficiency boost; it's a paradigm shift. It promises a future where software is more robust, secure, and delivered faster than ever before. The key will be for developers to embrace these tools and adapt their workflows to leverage the full potential of their new AI partners.</p>\n    ",

      "excerpt": "dfsdf",
      "content": "<p>There was a time when every phone call from my parents followed the same script.</p>\n<p>“Did you eat?”\n“Yes, I ate.”\n“How are you?”\n“I’m good. You?”\n“Yes, yes. Okay.”</p>\n<p>That was it — conversation over. No depth, no laughter, no real connection. Just routine check-ins disguised as love. We were tied by biology, bound by obligation, but missing something much deeper: understanding.</p>\n<p>The invisible wall between parents and children</p>\n<p>For the longest time, I couldn’t figure out why it felt so shallow — why every conversation felt like a checkbox rather than a bond. Then it hit me: we were still seeing each other through outdated lenses.</p>\n<p>I still saw them as parents — the authority figures who were supposed to fix everything, to always understand, to always know better. And they still saw me as a child — someone fragile, naive, in need of protection.</p>\n<p>That’s the problem with growing up: our roles evolve, but our perspectives don’t always keep up.</p>\n<p>When they were superheroes</p>\n<p>As children, we see our parents as superheroes. If we were hungry, they fed us. If we cried, they comforted us. If we couldn’t sleep, they stayed by our side until we drifted off.</p>\n<p>In our eyes, they could fix anything. They were strong, capable, invincible. And because of that, we never saw them as human beings — people who could be scared, lost, or broken inside.</p>\n<p>When we finally see the cracks</p>\n<p>Then one day, you grow up. You start seeing the world — and them — differently.</p>\n<p>You notice how your dad’s hands shake a little when he’s anxious. You see how your mom carries pain she never talks about. You realise that the people you once expected to have all the answers are still figuring things out too.</p>\n<p>But here’s the catch: while we’re busy realising they’re human, they’re still holding on to the idea that we’re not.</p>\n<p>The story that changed my perspective</p>\n<p>Four years ago, I quit my high-paying job — a decision I made after months of stress and self-doubt. When I told my dad, he was furious.</p>\n<p>We argued for days. I felt misunderstood and hurt. Why couldn’t he just support me? Didn’t he trust that I knew what I was doing?</p>\n<p>It took me a while to understand that it wasn’t about mistrust. It was about fear.</p>\n<p>He wasn’t trying to control me — he was trying to protect me. In his eyes, I was still the kid who couldn’t cross the road alone. He hadn’t yet met the adult version of me — the one capable of making choices, failing, learning, and trying again.</p>\n<p>And I was still expecting him to behave like a perfect parent, someone who always understood. But he wasn’t that anymore — maybe he never was. He was just a man, doing his best with what he knew.</p>\n<p>Seeing them as humans, not just parents</p>\n<p>That’s when I realised something powerful: to heal my relationship with my parents, I had to stop seeing them as “mom” and “dad” first.</p>\n<p>I had to see them as people. People who have made mistakes. People who have dreams that never came true. People who carry regrets they don’t talk about.</p>\n<p>And just like me, they’re learning how to love — sometimes awkwardly, sometimes imperfectly.</p>\n<p>When I started seeing them through that lens, something changed. The tension eased. The conversations softened. We started talking like equals, not like a parent and child bound by duty, but as two humans trying to love each other better.</p>\n<p>What healing might look like for you</p>\n<p>If your relationship with your parents feels strained or distant, maybe start here:</p>\n<p>See them as people, not titles. Forget “mom” or “dad” for a moment. Who are they, really? What shaped them? What hurts them?</p>\n<p>Let go of perfection. They don’t have to be the parents you imagined — and you don’t have to be the child they expected.</p>\n<p>Show compassion. Healing isn’t about forgetting; it’s about understanding.</p>\n<p>Let them see your growth. You’re no longer the kid who needed saving — and that’s okay.</p>\n<p>A gentle hope</p>\n<p>Maybe one day, when your phone rings and it’s mom or dad calling, the conversation won’t just be, “Did you eat?” or “How are you?”</p>\n<p>Maybe it’ll be, “Tell me about your day,” or “I’m proud of you,” or even, “I’m sorry.”</p>\n<p>Because at that moment, you won’t just be talking as parent and child anymore — but as two human beings, finally seeing each other clearly.</p>",
